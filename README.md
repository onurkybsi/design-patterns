# Design Patterns

We have been developing software for years. The problems that we need to solve most of the time in the software we develop are similar problems that have been previously solved by different software developers. Various **design patterns** have emerged as these similar problems have been handled over and over by various software developers. It would be wise in many ways to use these patterns. Patterns will be both *efficient* and *reliable* solutions as they arise from looking at problems from different perspectives and using in different situations.
