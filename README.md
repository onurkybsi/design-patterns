# Design Patterns

We have been developing software for years. The problems that we need to solve most of the time in the software we develop are similar problems that have been previously solved by different software developers. Various **design patterns** have emerged as these similar problems have been handled over and over by various software developers. It would be wise in many ways to use these patterns. Patterns will be both *efficient* and *reliable* solutions as they arise from looking at problems from different perspectives and using in different situations.

It is possible to divide the design patterns that may be suitable depending on various needs into three categories in the context of the solution they offer; [creational patterns](https://github.com/onurkybsi/design-patterns/tree/main/creational), [structural patterns](https://github.com/onurkybsi/design-patterns/tree/main/structural), [behavioral patterns](https://github.com/onurkybsi/design-patterns/tree/main/behavioral).

## Note

The implementations of the design patterns may change. Developers can implement the patterns depending on the context in which they are used. End of the day, every pattern brings a solution to a problem, but small changes in the implementation can of course be expected depending on the context.

My main goal in this project is to keep the explanations and examples as simple as possible and to cover the basic ideas of the patterns. I will stay away from the details as much as possible and try to explain the main idea. So you shouldn't see the example implementations as production-ready. Grab the idea and make it perfect for your case!
