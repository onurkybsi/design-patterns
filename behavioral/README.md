# Behavioral Design Patterns

## Observer

### Overview

Observer design pattern proposes a way for the communication between several components(**observers**) through a common channel. In this pattern, you basically have a **subject** component which can notify its observers when the state of the subject is changed. The state might be changed by different sources like one of the observers or an external request.

### When

Basically, you can try to implement _Observer design pattern_ when you want to establish a one-to-many relationship between the components which might interest the state of a common subject.

###Â Why

The best part of this pattern is probably _to have unlimited numbers of loosely coupled, reusable components which needs consistency_ between them. The subject component doesn't know anything about its observers except that they support an interface which it can use to notify them. So the subject can be exteded with new obsevers. On the other hand, the observers don't know anything about each other ...
